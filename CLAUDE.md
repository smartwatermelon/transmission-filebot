## Project Overview

Transmission-Plex Media Manager: A bash-based automation system that integrates Transmission BitTorrent client with FileBot and Plex Media Server. When downloads complete, it automatically cleans, organizes, renames media files, and triggers Plex library updates.

**Stack**: Pure Bash 5.x, strict POSIX compliance, zero external frameworks, comprehensive BATS test coverage

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **transmission-done.sh** - Main processing script (1,390 lines)
   - Entry point triggered by Transmission on download completion
   - Orchestrates cleanup → FileBot processing → Plex notification
   - Contains inline test suite (run with `TEST_MODE=true`)
   - Triple-mode design: production execution, inline test harness, BATS test support

2. **install.sh** - Interactive installation wizard (478 lines)
   - Dependency checking and installation
   - Plex server validation and token authentication
   - Auto-detects Plex library paths and presents as menu
   - Generates `~/.config/transmission-done/config.yml`
   - Creates symlink at `~/.local/bin/transmission-done`

3. **run_tests.sh** - BATS test runner (122 lines)
   - Executes comprehensive test suite
   - Auto-installs bats-core if missing
   - Runs unit tests (test/unit/*.bats)
   - Runs integration tests (test/integration/*.bats)
   - 114 total tests covering all functionality

4. **config.yml** - YAML configuration
   - Located at `~/.config/transmission-done/config.yml` (production)
   - Or `./config.yml` (local development override)
   - Contains paths, Plex credentials, logging settings

### Test Infrastructure

**Structure**:

```
test/
├── test_helper.bash           - Shared test utilities and assertions
├── unit/                      - Unit tests (84 tests)
│   ├── test_error_logging.bats
│   ├── test_file_safety.bats
│   ├── test_filebot.bats
│   ├── test_mode_detection.bats
│   ├── test_plex_api.bats
│   └── test_type_detection.bats
└── integration/               - Integration tests (30 tests)
    ├── test_manual_mode.bats
    ├── test_movie_workflow.bats
    └── test_tv_workflow.bats
```

**Test modes**:

- `TEST_MODE=true` - Inline tests in transmission-done.sh
- `TEST_RUNNER=true` - BATS test execution mode
- `./run_tests.sh` - Runs full BATS suite (114 tests)

### Processing Flow

```
Transmission download completes
  ↓
transmission-done.sh triggered with TR_TORRENT_* env vars
  ↓
Config validation (read_config)
  ↓
Cleanup phase (cleanup_torrent)
  - Removes .nfo, .exe, .txt files
  ↓
Media detection (process_media)
  - Pattern matching: S01E01 → TV, (19|20)XX → Movie
  - Tries most likely type first, falls back if needed
  ↓
FileBot processing
  - TV: TheTVDB database → {plex} format
  - Movie: TheMovieDB database → {plex} format
  - Actions: move, artwork, metadata, subtitles
  ↓
Plex notification (trigger_plex_scan)
  - Section 1 (movies) or Section 2 (TV shows)
  - Retry logic: 3 attempts, 5s delays
  ↓
Cleanup empty directories
```

### Key Design Patterns

- **Strict mode everywhere**: `set -euo pipefail` with `IFS=$'\n\t'`
- **Test mode injection**: Functions check `TEST_MODE` flag and mock external calls
- **Config precedence**: Local ./config.yml → User ~/.config/transmission-done/config.yml
- **Retry with exponential backoff**: `plex_make_request` supports configurable retries
- **Pattern-based media type detection**: Filename analysis before attempting FileBot processing
- **stdout/stderr separation**: All user messages to stderr, only data to stdout

### Critical Environment Variables

When Transmission invokes the script, it provides:

- `TR_TORRENT_DIR` - Download location (required)
- `TR_TORRENT_NAME` - Torrent name (required)
- `TR_TORRENT_HASH`, `TR_TORRENT_ID` - Identifiers
- `TR_TIME_LOCALTIME` - Completion timestamp
- Limited `PATH` - Script explicitly adds `/usr/local/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin`
- No `HOME` variable - Script uses `config.yml:paths.default_home` fallback

The script's `validate_environment` function enforces these requirements.

## Development Commands

### Testing

```bash
# Run full BATS test suite (110 tests)
./run_tests.sh

# Run only unit tests
bats test/unit/*.bats

# Run only integration tests
bats test/integration/*.bats

# Run inline tests (legacy, use run_tests.sh instead)
TEST_MODE=true ./transmission-done.sh

# Test specific scenario with mocked environment
TR_TORRENT_DIR=/path/to/test \
TR_TORRENT_NAME="Test.Show.S01E01" \
TEST_MODE=true \
./transmission-done.sh
```

### Installation & Configuration

```bash
# Run installation wizard (checks deps, validates Plex, generates config)
./install.sh

# Validate config file syntax
yq eval '.' ~/.config/transmission-done/config.yml

# Test Plex connectivity
curl -H "X-Plex-Token: YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:32400/identity
```

### Linting

```bash
# Check shell script quality (must be clean, no disable directives)
shellcheck transmission-done.sh install.sh run_tests.sh

# Check test scripts
shellcheck test/test_helper.bash
shellcheck test/unit/*.bats
shellcheck test/integration/*.bats

# Verify executable permissions
chmod +x transmission-done.sh install.sh run_tests.sh
```

### Debugging

```bash
# Watch processing logs in real-time
tail -f ~/.local/state/transmission-processing.log

# Inspect Transmission environment (add to script temporarily)
env > /tmp/transmission-env.log

# Verify Plex library sections
curl -H "X-Plex-Token: YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:32400/library/sections
```

## Configuration File Structure

```yaml
version: 1.0
paths:
  default_home: /Users/username  # HOME fallback for Transmission context
plex:
  server: http://localhost:32400  # Plex server URL
  token: abc123xyz                # Obtained during install.sh
  media_path: /path/to/plex/media # Target directory for organized media
logging:
  file: .local/state/transmission-processing.log  # Relative to home
  max_size: 10485760  # Bytes (10MB) - triggers log rotation
```

## Important Constraints

### Bash Script Rules (from Andrew's guidelines)

1. **GNU Bash 5.x compatible only** - No Bash 3.x fallbacks
2. **All shellcheck issues must be resolved** - Errors, warnings, AND info
3. **NEVER use `# shellcheck disable` directives**
4. **Critical**: Never use `((var++))` with `set -e` - when var=0, this exits silently. Use `((var += 1))` instead
5. **Remove unused variables completely** - Don't suppress with `_var` or shellcheck disables
6. **stdout/stderr discipline**: User messages to stderr (`>&2`), only data to stdout for capture with `$(...)`

### Testing Philosophy

- Tests are NOT optional - every behavior change requires test updates
- Test mode mocks external dependencies (Plex API, FileBot, df, stat)
- Tests run in isolated temp directories (`TEST_TEMP_DIR`)
- BATS tests use custom assertions in test_helper.bash
- Expected: 114 tests passing (84 unit + 30 integration)

### Plex API Hardcoded Sections

The script assumes:

- Section ID 1 = Movies
- Section ID 2 = TV Shows

If your Plex has different IDs, modify `trigger_plex_scan` function.

### FileBot Requirements

- Licensed version required (free trial won't work for automation)
- Must be in PATH or at `/usr/local/bin/filebot` or `/opt/homebrew/bin/filebot`
- Format string `{plex}` is Plex-optimized naming convention
- Database selection: `TheTVDB` for TV, `TheMovieDB` for movies

## NAS Storage Configuration

When media files are stored on a NAS (e.g., Synology) mounted via NFS, the NFS export settings are critical for FileBot to successfully move files.

### NFS Export Requirements

The NFS rule on the NAS shared folder must be configured as follows:

| Setting | Required Value | Why |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| Privilege | **Read/Write** | FileBot needs to move files and create directories |
| Squash | **Map all users to admin** | See UID mapping below |
| Security | **sys** | Standard AUTH_SYS authentication |
| Enable asynchronous | **Yes** | Performance |
| Allow non-privileged ports | **Yes** | Required for macOS NFS clients |
| Allow subfolder access | **Yes** | Media lives in subdirectories |

### UID Mapping Explained

NFS permission checks happen **server-side**, not client-side. The macOS `noowners` mount option only affects local display — the NAS still enforces permissions based on the UID it receives.

The challenge: macOS user UIDs (typically 501, 502) don't match Synology user UIDs (admin = 1024, other users = 1025+). With "No mapping" squash, the NAS receives the macOS UID and checks it against file ownership — which will fail because no Synology user has UID 501/502.

**"Map all users to admin"** solves this by mapping all NFS requests to the Synology admin user (UID 1024), which has full access to the shared folder.

### Directory Permissions

With "Map all users to admin" squash, **directories must be `rwxrwxrwx` (777)**. This is because:

- All NFS requests arrive as UID 1024 (Synology admin)
- Files/directories may be owned by different UIDs depending on what created them
- The admin user needs write access via the "other" permission bits
- This is acceptable for a media server on a firewalled LAN

If directories become non-writable (e.g., after an accidental `chmod 755`), fix from the NAS via SSH:

```bash
# On the Synology (requires sudo even for admin user):
sudo find /volume1/MediaShare/Media/ -type d -exec chmod 777 {} +
```

**Do NOT attempt `chmod` from the NFS client** — it will fail silently or with "Operation not permitted". Always SSH into the NAS.

### NFS Attribute Cache

After changing permissions or ownership on the NAS, the NFS client will serve stale metadata from its attribute cache. To pick up changes:

```bash
# Unmount and remount the NFS share:
sudo diskutil unmount force /path/to/mount
sudo mount -t nfs -o noowners nas.local:/volume1/share /path/to/mount
```

### Synology ACLs

Synology DSM defaults to "Windows ACL" mode on shared folders, which adds an ACL layer on top of UNIX permissions. The `+` suffix in `ls -la` output on the NAS indicates ACLs are present. These ACLs can **deny writes even when UNIX permissions allow them**. If experiencing unexplained permission issues, check the shared folder's permission model in DSM Control Panel → Shared Folder → Edit → Advanced.

### Containerized Transmission Setup

When Transmission runs in a container (e.g., podman/haugene), it cannot directly invoke macOS scripts. The `transmission-trigger-watcher.sh` daemon bridges this gap:

1. Container writes trigger files to a host-mounted directory on download completion
2. The watcher daemon polls for trigger files every 60 seconds
3. On finding a trigger, it maps the container's `/data` path to the macOS NFS mount path
4. It invokes `transmission-done.sh` with the correct `TR_TORRENT_*` environment variables
5. Dead-letter handling: after 5 failures, triggers are moved to `.dead` for manual inspection

## Common Gotchas

1. **PATH issues**: Transmission runs scripts with minimal PATH (`/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`). Script adds `/usr/local/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin` explicitly for Homebrew tools.

2. **Config location**: Script checks `./config.yml` first (development), then `~/.config/transmission-done/config.yml` (production). Keep secrets out of repo - use config.yml.template.

3. **Log rotation**: Happens on every script run if log exceeds `max_size`. Old log moved to `.log.old` (overwrites previous).

4. **Media type detection**: Pattern matching is case-insensitive but looks for specific formats. If filename has neither TV episode markers nor year, script tries movie first, then TV as fallback.

5. **Plex token exposure**: config.yml contains plaintext token. NEVER commit real config.yml (use config.yml.template).

6. **Test mode environment**: `TEST_RUNNER=true` bypasses Transmission variable validation during BATS test execution. Don't use in production.

7. **Command substitution**: Use `var=$(function)` to capture stdout. Functions must send user messages to stderr (`>&2`), not stdout, to avoid contamination.

8. **FileBot `[MOVE]` output parsing**: FileBot uses the same `[MOVE]` prefix for both successful and failed moves. A successful move logs `[MOVE] from [X] to [Y]`, while a failed move logs `[MOVE] from [X] to [Y] failed due to I/O error [...]`. When counting moved files, always exclude lines containing "failed" — use `grep "\[MOVE\]" | grep -vc "failed"`, not `grep -c "\[MOVE\]"`.

9. **NFS permission errors appear as FileBot I/O errors**: If FileBot reports `Access Denied` with details like `(rwxrwxrwx 502:20 file.mkv -> r-xr-xr-x 502:20 Season 02)`, the issue is NAS-side directory permissions, not FileBot configuration. See the NAS Storage Configuration section.

## Dependencies

All must be available in PATH:

- **yq** (`brew install yq`) - YAML parsing, required for config
- **xmlstarlet** (`brew install xmlstarlet`) - XML parsing for Plex API responses
- **jq** (`brew install jq`) - JSON parsing for Plex API authentication
- **curl** (pre-installed on macOS) - HTTP requests
- **bats-core** (`brew install bats-core`) - Test framework
- **filebot** (licensed) - Media organization engine
- **find**, **grep**, **stat**, **df** - Standard Unix utilities

The `install.sh` wizard checks and can auto-install missing dependencies.

## Transmission Integration

Configure in Transmission:

1. Preferences → Downloading tab
2. Check "Run script when download completes"
3. Enter symlink path: `~/.local/bin/transmission-done`
   (or direct path: `/path/to/transmission-done.sh`)

Ensure script is executable: `chmod +x transmission-done.sh`

## Security Notes

- **config.yml contains sensitive data**: Plex token grants full server access
- **Git ignore prevents accidental commits**: config.yml in .gitignore
- **Template provided**: config.yml.template shows structure without secrets
- **Token validation**: install.sh validates token before saving
- **Symlink safety**: install.sh refuses to overwrite regular files, only symlinks

## CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/test.yml`):

- **BATS Unit Tests** - Runs test/unit/*.bats
- **BATS Integration Tests** - Runs test/integration/*.bats
- **Inline Tests** - Runs TEST_MODE=true ./transmission-done.sh
- **ShellCheck Validation** - Lints all shell scripts
- **Test Summary** - Aggregates results

All 114 tests must pass before merging PRs.
